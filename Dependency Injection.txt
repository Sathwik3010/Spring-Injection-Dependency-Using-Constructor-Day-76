Dependency Injection
====================
in this approach service provider will create the services and service provider will send the services to the main application directly.

there are 2 types of dependency Injections such as 
1) Constructor dependency Injection
-----------------------------------
	The process of injecting a object through a constructor is called constructor dependency injection if you want to implement constructor dependency injection in spring applications we have to use the following tags in spring configurations tags under bean tag.

<bean id="----" class="----"/>
	<constructor-arg name="----" value="----"/>
	<constructor-arg name="----" value="----"/>
	<constructor-arg name="----" value="----"/>
<beans/>

2) Setter method dependency Injection
-------------------------------------
the process of Injecting a dependency Object through its respective setter method is called Setter method dependency Injection.
<bean id="----" class="---">
	<property name="---" value="---" />
	<property name="---" value="---" />
	<property name="---" value="---" />
</bean>
Interview Questions
-------------------
In Spring applications if we provide both setter method dependency injection and constructor dependency injection in a single bean object what will happen in spring application

ans) in spring applications if we provide both constructor dependency and setter method dependency injection in a single bean then constructor dependency injection is overridden by setter method dependency injection method finally we are able to get only setter method dependency injection provided values in bean object.
